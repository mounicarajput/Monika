Hey 👋 I’m Monika.  
Funny thing, I never wanted to do engineering, yet here I am with 6+ years of experience in tech. Interesting, right?

I started this journey back in **2019**—completely unsure if this was something I really wanted. Honestly, even today I don’t always have the answer. But I’ve always believed in one thing: *whatever comes my way, I will give it my 101%.* That mindset has carried me through internships, working as a data scientist, diving into NLP and computer vision, consulting, and even building end-to-end products. Sometimes that meant writing frontend code (not my first love 😅) just so I could see the end result of what I created.  

That passion to build something real, something people can use—keeps me learning new tech and finding ways to make it relatable to everyone, even those outside the tech world.

## My Journey

In **2023**, life threw me a curveball. Like many others, I was impacted by the recession and lost my job. It was a tough time, suddenly, I went from working with brilliant people to having no title, no identity, and realising I had rarely shared the things I had built.  

That’s when **chapter two** of my career started. I began sharing my knowledge with the world.  
- I started speaking at conferences.  
- I became a judge at hackathons and mentored at **40+ events**.  
- I learned how to tell my story: how someone from a tier-3 college with average schooling could still work with some of the best minds in tech.  

👉 You can check out my [talk schedule](https://sessionize.com/mounicarajput/).  

From April 2023 till now, I’ve discovered so much about myself beyond just “writing code.” I realised I love advocating for technology, making it accessible, and connecting it with real users.  

Some milestones I’m proud of:  
- **CNCF Ambassador**  [Link](https://www.credly.com/badges/186c05a4-c423-4968-adc5-cf2b7a27f195)
- **CNCG Organizer**  [Link](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-gurugram/)
- **Program Committee Member** for India, Japan, China, and North America  [Link](https://www.credly.com/users/monika-rajput.785a4f40/badges#credly)
- **Keynote Speaker at KubeCon India**  [Link](https://kccncind2025.sched.com/event/76c6d6e459f0e8d8fec68c762f74a641#sched-content)

And the one I’m most excited about—the thing that finally got checked off my to-do list—is starting my **YouTube Podcast Channel: [TMS](https://www.youtube.com/@mounicarajput)** 🎙️.  
Here, I host conversations with amazing people in tech about Cloud, Data, AI, open source, and even founders’ journeys.

## What’s Next

For my next role and challenge, I want to thrive in a space where I can **talk about tech, build with it, and make it meaningful for people**. Here’s what excites me most:  

1. Working with a company that **cares about community, feedback, and transparency**—sharing not just *what* they’re building, but *why*.  
2. Advocating products in **Data, AI, and Cloud**—showing how they work, how they solve problems, and why they matter for specific use cases.  
3. Building **prototypes and agent-based apps**. For example, here’s a quick finance tracking app I hacked together in a few hours using Lovable, Cursor, and Vercel: [FinApp Prototype](https://pennywise-pal-51-29miz3i9j-mounicarajputs-projects.vercel.app/).  
4. Solving business problems through **data engineering**. You can find some of my writing here: [Blogs](https://medium.com/@Monikarajput).
