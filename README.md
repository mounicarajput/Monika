Hey 👋 I’m Monika Rajput.  
Funny thing, I never wanted to do engineering, yet here I am with 6+ years of experience in tech. Interesting, right?

I started this journey back in **2019**—completely unsure if this was something I really wanted. Honestly, even today, I don’t always have the answer. But I’ve always believed in one thing: *whatever comes my way, I will give it my 101%.* That mindset has carried me through internships, working as a data scientist, diving into NLP and computer vision, consulting, and even building end-to-end products. Sometimes that meant writing frontend code (not my first love 😅) just so I could see the end result of what I created.  

That passion to build something real, something people can use—keeps me learning new tech and finding ways to make it relatable to everyone, even those outside the tech world.

## My Journey

In **2023**, life threw me a curveball. Like many others, I was impacted by the recession and lost my job. It was a tough time. Suddenly, I went from working with brilliant people to having no title, no identity, and realising I had rarely shared the things I had built.  

That’s when **chapter two** of my career started. I began sharing my knowledge with the world.  
- I started speaking at conferences.  
- I became a judge at hackathons and mentored at **40+ events**.  
- I learned how to tell my story: how someone from a tier-3 college with average schooling could still work with some of the best minds in tech.  

👉 You can check out my [talk schedule](https://sessionize.com/mounicarajput/).  

From April 2023 till now, I’ve discovered so much about myself beyond just “writing code.” I realised I love advocating for technology, making it accessible, and connecting it with real users.  

Some milestones I’m proud of:  
- **CNCF Ambassador**  [Link](https://www.credly.com/badges/186c05a4-c423-4968-adc5-cf2b7a27f195)
- **CNCG Organizer**  [Link](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-gurugram/)
- **Program Committee Member** for India, Japan, China, and North America  [Link](https://www.credly.com/users/monika-rajput.785a4f40/badges#credly)
- **Keynote Speaker at KubeCon India**  [Link](https://kccncind2025.sched.com/event/76c6d6e459f0e8d8fec68c762f74a641#sched-content)

And the one thing I’m most excited about is the thing that finally got checked off my to-do list is starting my **YouTube Podcast Channel: [TMS](https://www.youtube.com/@mounicarajput)** 🎙️.  
Here, I host conversations with amazing people in tech about Cloud, Data, AI, open source, and even founders’ journeys.

## What’s Next

For my next role and challenge, I want to thrive in a space where I can **talk about tech, build with it, and make it meaningful for people**. Here’s what excites me most:  

1. Working with a company that **cares about community, feedback, and transparency**, sharing not just *what* they’re building, but *why*.  
2. Advocating products in **Data, AI, and Cloud**, showing how they work, how they solve problems, and why they matter for specific use cases.  
3. Building **prototypes and agent-based apps**. For example, here’s a quick finance tracking app I hacked together in a few hours using Lovable, Cursor, and Vercel: [FinApp Prototype](https://pennywise-pal-51-29miz3i9j-mounicarajputs-projects.vercel.app/).  
4. Solving business problems through **data engineering**. You can find some of my writing here: [Blogs](https://medium.com/@Monikarajput).
5. Show up for the company at big conferences, trade shows, and events, not just to build brand presence but to actually connect with people and spark conversations that turn into opportunities.
6. Work hand-in-hand with Sales, Product, and Design, because growth isn’t just about numbers, it’s about making the whole user journey feel meaningful, from the first interaction to them actually loving the product.
